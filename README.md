# Clean git branches

Allows to iterate over git branches list, search each of them for pull requests created on Github and delete by confirmation.

These was done to clear local branches list when Github's `squash and merge` method used on pull requests â€” merges are mot detected automatically.

You need python 2.7+ and `pip install PyGitHub`.

NB for Python 2.7 on Centos 6.5: `yum install python2.7` and then `scl enable python27 bash` will launch bash with `python` aliased to 2.7 version. 

Example usage:
```
bash-4.1$ ./clean-git-branches.sh
Enter base branch name: HEAD
OK, base branch set to HEAD.

Enter branches list specifier: git branch | grep -v \\* | grep -v master | grep -v development
Search Github for pull requests? (y/N): y
Ok, each branch will be searched for pull request state using Github API.
You need to provide credentials if you want to check branches from private repos
or they will be incorrectly marked as not having pull requests associated.
Github login or token (optional): b1rdex
Github password (optional):
